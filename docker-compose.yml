    # Environment variables (Optional: for passing sensitive config later)
    # The current setup reads the API URL from Config.py, but this is how you'd override it:
    # environment:
    #   - OLLAMA_API_URL=https://ollama.craysoftware.com/api/generate
      
    # Use 'tty: true' and 'stdin_open: true' to keep the container running and allow 
    # interaction with the console menus (Live Council Debate, Backtest, etc.)
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    
    # Use 'restart: on-failure' or 'always' if you want it to automatically restart
    # restart: unless-stopped
    
    # Optional: Mount your local code directory. 
    # This is excellent for development, as changes to council.py are reflected instantly.
